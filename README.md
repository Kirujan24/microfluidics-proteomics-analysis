# microfluidics-proteomics-analysis-
R scripts for NTA and proteomics analysis used in a microfluidic urinary EV study
Note: Raw data are not included due to size and sample confidentiality.
## Contents
Scripts/nta_analysis.R: NTA size distribution and <150 nm enrichment analysis  
Scripts/proteomics_analysis.R: LC–MS/MS proteomics processing and GO analysis  
run_all.R: Wrapper script to reproduce the main analyses
## Experimental context
Samples were processed sequentially (Pre-MF → Pass-1 → Pass-2 → Pass-3). 
Proteomics and TEM analyses were performed on the final microfluidic fraction (Pass-3).
## Usage
Scripts were executed in R; paths and column names may need adjustment for other datasets.
